# An example weekly quizz assignment

This repository contains all the necessary files for a weekly code quizz/assignment. The aim of this repository is to allow students to work on their own writing some simple code that has to fulfill some basic requirements, and submit their efforts for grading to Github


### The assignments
The assignments are given in several files. The files are

* `assignment1.py`: Calculate the length (in characters) of an arbitrary string.
* `assignment2.py`: Change all occurrences of a substring `s` in a given string to `#` (the hash symbol)

### Setup command
Once you click on the repl.it icon, you'll be taken to the repl.it site. On the right hand side window, you need to install `pytest`:
`pip3 install pytest`

### Change the code
Edit the contents of the files `assignment1.py` and `assignment2.py` until you think they work.


### Test your code
On the right hand side, you can run automatic tests that will check your code by typing:
`pytest`

You can run this as many times as you want, until (hopefully!) all the tests pass.

### Upload you changes back to Github

Click on the 2nd icon on the left hand side, and you can submit a commit back to Github. Add your comment and click "Push".
