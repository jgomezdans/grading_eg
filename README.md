# An example weekly quizz assignment

This repository contains all the necessary files for a weekly code quizz/assignment. The aim of this repository is to allow students to work on their own writing some simple code that has to fulfill some basic requirements, and submit their efforts for grading to Github


### The assignments
The assignments are given in several files. The files h

* `assignment1.py`: Calculate the length (in characters) of an arbitrary string.
* `assignment2.py`: Change all occurrences of a substring `s` in a given string to `#` (the hash symbol)

### Setup command
`sudo -H pip3 install pytest`

### Run command
`pytest`

### Notes
- pip's install path is not included in the PATH var by default, so without installing via `sudo -H`, pytest would be unaccessible.
